# Tailwind findings

## Pros

- Possibility to just use a CSS class based architecture that could give a lot room of flexibility
- They can play along with `styled-components`
- IDE and text editor plugins are good

## Cons

- Scaffolding and configuration a bit cumbersome
- New joiners onboarding could be difficult
- Tailwind as an open source product just give us CSS modularity, but if we want to use their own components we need to pay

## Comments

- Very detailed documentation but its hard to navigate without using their search functionality, not really an issue but an observation
- Brings in two other dependencies with tailwindcss: postcss and autoprefixer
