# Materialize UI findings

## Pros

- Nice and easy components interfaces, specially with showin and renderin errors.
- Play along with `styled-components`
- Gives you a good base to style from
- Seems like there's good documentation

## Cons

- Loads of boilerplate
- Bring a lot of depedencies and cruft to the project

## Comments

Pedro: I can see this could benefit in the beginning with speed, but if we want to make something that is not covered in Material UI library we should make it by scratch and add more weight to the source code.
